    I love music and enjoy playing the piano and guitar. I used to sing as a tenor in <a href="https://music.163.com/#/artist?id=28420206">BUAA Chorus</a> and enjoyed sharing some covers on Netease and QQ Music. 
    Some of my best friends are incredible music players and singers, and I’m so thankful for all the happiness they’ve brought me through music.

    A special thanks to my girlfriend, Sijing, for always being by my side with her support and love.
