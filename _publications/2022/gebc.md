  We introduced three tasks of video boundary understanding on our new dataset called Kinetics-GEB+ (Generic Event Boundary Plus), consisting of over 170k boundaries associated with captions in 12K videos. Besides, we designed a new Temporal-based Pairwise Difference (TPD) Modeling method for visual difference representation and achieved significant performance improvements.
